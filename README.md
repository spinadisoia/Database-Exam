# DatabaseExam
My exam for my Bachelor's degree Database exam

In addition to the written exam, the Database exam includes the submission of a project.  This involves creating a database for the "From Botany to Big Data" citizen science initiative in schools. It aims to support school projects related to gardens, storing information on schools, classes, participants, and gardens. The database will also manage plant-related data for biomonitoring and phytoremediation, along with environmental information acquired through sensors or Arduino boards.

Within the scope of my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Statistics and Data Management, the Database examination carries a weight of 8 CFU and is an integral component of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree curriculum. The collaborative team for this endeavor comprised myself and two Computer Science students. Consequently, my contribution amounted to 2/3 of the overall project, as certain aspects were aligned with the Computer Science curriculum, which diverges from my academic specialization.
